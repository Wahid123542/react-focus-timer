# React Focus Timer 
Hey! This is a simple focus timer I made with React to help me stay focused while studying or coding.
It uses the classic Pomodoro style: 25 minutes of work + 5 minute break.  
I like the orange color because it feels energetic and keeps me awake 😄

### Features
- Big timer in the middle with progress circle that fills up as time passes
- Shows "Focus Mode On" when you're working (hides during break so it's less distracting)
- Plays a small bell sound when time is up
- Pause, reset, and auto-switch between focus and break
- Super simple orange theme
